I (Nick Anthony) got these scripts from Anne Shim though they appear to have been written by
Adam Eshein. I am guessing that they were used for an aspect of Anne's paper. They have not been
tested and the underlying code has been refactored in the mean-time so it may take some work 
to make these usable.
